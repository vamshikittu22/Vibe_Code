# AI Coding Platform Master Summary

## Competitor Features

**Cursor**

- Deep VS Code integration with powerful agent mode and robust multi-file refactoring
- Usage-based “mystery box” pricing led to unexpected lockouts, context loss, and quality degradation after June 2025 pricing change[^1][^2]
- Strong developer loyalty despite pricing complaints

**Windsurf**

- Enterprise-grade “Cascade” multi-file change engine and competitive base pricing
- Credit plans (500–3 000 prompts) insufficient for heavy users; excessive credit consumption by web search makes core features impractical

**Lovable**

- No-code rapid prototyping, GitHub integration, one-click deployment, conversational interface
- Credit-based model penalizes error correction, depleting credits; struggles with complex apps and design customization

**Replit**

- Full-stack development environment with collaborative coding and deployment tools, education focus
- Serious trust issues after AI agent deleted a production database and generated fake data in July 2025; public apology issued

**v0 by Vercel**

- Excellent React/Next.js UI generation and seamless deployment to Vercel
- Token-based pricing increased costs 10×–100×; code quality regression and poor instruction handling in later sessions


## UI/UX Patterns for AI Chat Interfaces

**AI Assistant Cards**: Structured panels for rich media and interactive elements, improving clarity over linear chat bubbles[^1]
**Progressive Disclosure**: Stepwise reveal of options reduces cognitive overload and guides users through complex workflows[^1]
**Contextual Input Methods**: Intent-driven shortcuts and real-time data integration anticipate user needs and streamline interactions[^3]
**In-Chat Interactive Elements**: Inline code snippets, tables, charts, and media maintain conversational flow for complex tasks[^3]
**Co-Pilot with Artifacts**: Real-time collaborative editing and artifact generation turn AI into a creative partner, preserving context across sessions[^3]

## MVP Feature Prioritization

**Must-Have**

- Real-time AI-powered code editor with syntax highlighting and multi-file support
- Secure authentication (email/password), user profiles, and project management (create/rename/delete, file explorer)
- Streaming code generation via backend proxy for API key management
- Session persistence and read-only sharing links

**Should-Have**

- Advanced editor features (multi-cursor, tabbed interface, themes)
- Pre-built prompt templates and “Ask AI” sidebar
- GitHub import/export, ZIP download
- Real-time co-editing, inline comments, usage analytics dashboard

**Nice-to-Have**

- Plugin marketplace, built-in terminal, one-click deployment
- Voice-driven coding, automatic documentation generation
- Gamification with badges and leaderboards


## Technical Architecture

**Frontend (React + TypeScript)**

- Component-based design, Context API/useReducer for state, custom hooks, lazy loading, PWA support
- Monaco Editor integration with lazy loading, web worker offloading, model caching, React.memo optimizations

**Backend (Node.js + Express)**

- MVC layering (controllers, services, models, middleware) with JWT-based auth (bcrypt, RBAC, Redis sessions)
- Secure Gemini API proxy, environment-variable key storage, rate limiting, streaming response handling

**Real-Time Layer (Socket.IO)**

- Persistent bidirectional connections, room-based isolation, automatic reconnection, event-driven updates

**Performance \& Scalability**

- Redis caching, database connection pooling, horizontal scaling via Kubernetes, MongoDB sharding
- Webpack/Vite bundle optimization, service workers, message batching, graceful degradation

**Deployment \& Monitoring**

- Docker/Kubernetes with blue-green deploys, CDN/static hosting for frontend, Nginx or cloud load balancers
- Prometheus metrics, structured logging, audit trails, intrusion detection, GDPR/SOC 2 compliance


## Prompt Templates

**Code Generation:**
> “Generate a [feature] using [language/framework] with [requirements]. Ensure [constraints]. Return only the code snippet.”

**Refactoring Request:**
> “Refactor this [language] function to improve [aspect: performance/readability] and include comments explaining changes.”

**Feature Extension:**
> “Add [new feature] to the existing [component/module] in [language/framework]. API calls should use [pattern] and handle errors with [strategy].”

**Bug Fixing:**
> “Find and fix the bug in this [language] code that causes [issue]. Provide a brief explanation of the root cause.”

**Testing Prompt:**
> “Write unit tests for the [function/module] in [language/framework], covering edge cases for [conditions]. Use [testing library].”
